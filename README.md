# JS Questions:

## Explain event delegation ##

## Explain how `this` works in JavaScript ## 

This refers to the object that you are currently inside.
For example, in an object, `this` can be used to reference a property of the object like `this.cheese`

## Explain how prototypal inheritance works ## 

A prototype is a template for something. If you inherit from a prototype, you get all of its methods and properties

 ##  What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS? ## 

I dont know

 ##  Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: ## 
  An `IIFE` stands for `Immediately invoking function expression`.
 `function foo(){ }();`

   It wouldn't work because the compiler thinks it is a *function declaration## rather  ###than a *function expression*

   ### What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE? ###

  Put brackets around the function so that the compiler treats it as an expression, not a declaration.

  Example of it working:

  ```js
  (function foo(){ console.log('go!');})();
  ```

## What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or undeclared? ##

  `null` is an object. You can use when creating variables when you don't have a value yet.

 `undefined` is a type. It is when a variable does not exist. All assigned (no value assigned to it yet) variables have a value of undefined.

`undeclared` means the variable was declared without the `var` keyword, e.g. `cheese = 2;` It is in the global scope.


  ### How would you go about checking for any of these states? ###

  You could check if it is null with `cheese === null`
  You can check if its undefined by going `typeOf(cheese) === 'undefined'` (typeOf always returns a string)
  I DONT KNOW HOW TO CHECK FOR UNDECLARED

## What is a closure, and how/why would you use one? ##

A closure is a function that contains another function. The other function knows the vars of the one its in, but they are private. NOÂ¬

## Can you describe the main difference between a `forEach` loop and a `.map()` loop and why you would pick one versus the other? ##

A map is more suited if you want to create a copy of the thing but modified by a function.

## What's a typical use case for anonymous functions? ##

In a callback?

## How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance? ##

I dont know :(

## What's the difference between host objects and native objects? ###

Nope

## Difference between: `function Person(){}`, `var person = Person()`, and `var person = new Person()`?

`function Person(){}` is a function declaration
`var person = Person()` is an expression, and when run it will take the value returned from Person and assign to person
`var person = new Person()` assigns a new object instance to the variable person

## What's the difference between `.call` and `.apply`? ###

dunno fam

## Explain `Function.prototype.bind`. ###

Changes the value of this to be that of the parents.

## What's the difference between feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA  ###string?
## Explain Ajax in as much detail as possible. ###

AJAX stands for Asyncronous javascript and xml

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Ajax? ###
## Explain how JSONP works (and how it's not really Ajax). ###
## Have you ever used JavaScript templating? ###
   ### If so, what libraries have you used? ###

   I use template strings yes..


## Explain "hoisting". ###

Hoisting is where a function declarations are loaded before any code is executed. so even if the function is called above where it sits in the code, it will still work because it is stored in memory. therefore it is like the function declaration has been `hoisted` to the top of the file

## Describe event bubbling. ###

Where events, like clicks, bubble up from child to parent and so on. Like an onclick in a dom for example?

## What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property"? ###

i thought an attribute was like in HTML where <a class="attribute"> but a property is something that a javascript object or class can have, which can be accessed with dot notation.

## Why is extending built-in JavaScript objects not a good idea? ###

Because you might break everything?

## Difference between document load event and document DOMContentLoaded event? ###
## What is the difference between `==` and `===`? ###
## Explain the same-origin policy with regards to JavaScript. ###
## Make this work: ###
```javascript

```
## Why is it called a Ternary operator, what does the word "Ternary" indicate? ###

Ternary means theres's 3 parts to it.

## What is `"use strict";`? what are the advantages and disadvantages to using it? ###


* Create a for loop that iterates up to `100` while outputting **"fizz"** at multiples of `3`, **"buzz"** at multiples of `5` and **"fizzbuzz"** at multiples of `3` and `5`
* Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch it?
